## Review Notes 

 * move ajax functions to their own folder
 * cover the routes and db methods with nightwatch integration tests
 * signin and signup need sinon spies passed into them
 * setup code coverage (istanbul)
 * what is upload.js?
 * are there plans to rewrite the upload feature?
 * a final tidyup will be to delete dummy, fake routes and console.logs
